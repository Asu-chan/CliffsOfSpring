# Super Mario and the Cliffs of Spring
## Source Code Public Release

### Preamble

Here's the source code for the **Super Mario and the Cliffs of Spring** mod!

You can see the release trailer of the mod (along with the download link) right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmsuylqnqXE)!

There isn't much stuff but I guess some of these code hacks can be useful to some people?

Also, code changes done here wouldn't have been possible without the work of the Newer Team on [Kamek](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW), thanks to them and go play their mod [**Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii**](https://newerteam.com/wii/) if you haven't already.
